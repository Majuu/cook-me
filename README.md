# Cook me

## What and why
The aim of this project is to show my ability to develop a React-native applications. 
It was one of my 2023 goals to improve and finish the abandoned application from the past, hence my github is a bit more tidied up for those who want to see what I can do with the mobile app development. This application is just an example of my skills, it does not show my whole knowledge.

## Main technologies
- React-native
- json-server
- redux-toolkit
- react-navigation
- formik
- react-native-svg-transformer & react-native-svg
- the rest can be looked up in `package.json` file

## About the project itself
The project is a quite simple coooking book with predefined recipes. The user can search for a recipe (manually by scrolling / with search input / with category filtering), read the recipe details, add a recipe to the list of favourites and add his custom recipe.
The project also includes 'Learn the basics' tab which consists of sample videos of basic kitchen activities for learning purposes.
The project works both on IOS and Android.
