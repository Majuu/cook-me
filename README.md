# Cook me

## What and why

The aim of this project is to show my ability to develop a React-native application. 
It was one of my 2023 goals to finish the abandoned application from the past, hence my github is a bit more tidied up for those who want to see what I can do with the development.

## Main technologies
- React-native
- json-server - as a REST API
- redux-toolkit - as a global store for keeping recipes across the application
- react-navigation - for handling navigation
- formik - for handling and validating the new recipe form
- react-native-svg-transformer & react-native-svg - for injecting images into the application
- the rest can be looked up in `package.json` file

## About the project itself

The project is a quite simple coooking book with predefined recipes. The user can see the recipe details, add a recipe to the list of favourites and add his custom recipe.
